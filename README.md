1. PySimpleGui : 
  PySimpleGUI is a python library that wraps tkinter, Qt (pyside2), wxPython and Remi (for browser support), allowing very fast and simple-to-learn GUI programming. PySimpleGUI defaults to using tkinter, but the user can change to another supported GUI library by just changing one line. The module was chosen due to its ease to learn and convenience features that it provides with tkinter.
